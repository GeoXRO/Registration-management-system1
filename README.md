# Registration-management-system1

This Java program manages guest registrations for an event, allowing users to add, search, remove, and update guests, as well as manage a waiting list.

-Guest Class: Represents a guest with attributes like last name, first name, email, and phone number. It includes methods for accessing and modifying these attributes, as well as methods for equality comparison and string representation.

-GuestsList Class: Manages two lists â€” one for registered guests and another for the waiting list. It provides methods to add, remove, search, and display guests, as well as check the number of available spots and the size of the waiting list.

-Main Class: Implements a command-line interface where users can interact with the system using various commands like add, check, remove, update, and search. It handles input from the user to perform actions on the guest list.

The code demonstrates basic principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), user input handling, and data management with collections.
